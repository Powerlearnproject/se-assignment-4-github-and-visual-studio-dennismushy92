Github: Is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code; Primary function and feature of github includes Version Control: GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in files. Developers can see who made what changes, revert to previous versions, or merge changes from different contributors: Hosting Repositories: GitHub hosts Git repositories, allowing developers to store their code centrally and access it from anywhere: Collaboration: It facilitates collaboration among developers through features like pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking. Teams can discuss changes, suggest modifications, and manage tasks within the repository: Branching and Merging: Developers can create branches to work on features or fixes independently. GitHub makes it easy to merge these branches back into the main codebase after review: Community and Social Coding: GitHub is a social platform where developers can follow projects, star repositories, and discover code written by others. It encourages open source contributions and community involvement: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): GitHub integrates with CI/CD tools to automate testing and deployment workflows. This helps maintain code quality and streamline the release process etc. GitHub's features and ecosystem are designed to foster efficient, transparent, and collaborative software development, whether for small teams working on proprietary projects or large communities contributing to open-source initiatives.
Github repo: is a location where all the files for a particular project are stored. It uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes made to those files over time: How to create a repo, open a github account and click on the new then give it a new and follow all the steps up to "create" then click it, the essental elements that a repo should have includes; README file, .gitignore file, Code and Project Files, Documentation, Configuration Files and Licenses and Legal Documents.
Version control in the context of Git refers to the system and processes used to manage changes to a project’s files over time. It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project, tracks and manages changes to files, and helps maintain a complete history of modifications: GitHub enhances version control for developers by offering a robust platform built on Git's distributed version control system (VCS), combined with additional tools and features that streamline collaboration, code management, and project organization
Branches in GitHub are parallel versions of a repository, allowing you to work on different lines of development independently. They are a fundamental feature of Git's version control system and facilitate workflows where you can develop new features, fix bugs, or experiment without affecting the main or stable version of your project. Branches are important because Isolated Development, Version Management, Collaboration, Risk Mitigation, Feature Development, Bug Fixes and Experimentation. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JewNR2P2Lgx9AWA4GhI9vbeia_AOEoNGa_kUN8WxNgQ/edit?usp=sharing
A pull request in GitHub is a feature that allows developers to propose changes to a codebase. It is a request to merge a set of changes from one branch into another.Pull requests are an integral part of collaborative software development, fostering better code quality, transparency, and teamwork. They streamline the code review process, facilitate discussion and feedback, and integrate seamlessly with development workflows to ensure stable and maintainable codebases. https://docs.google.com/document/d/17227DIFuU1JLPsha6PooYd8tOphdcRfPkzDlTyKOY8c/edit?usp=sharing
GitHub Actions is a powerful tool provided by GitHub that enables automation of workflows directly within GitHub repositories. It integrates seamlessly with GitHub to facilitate Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), among other automated tasks; https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DL55-_nHYaXeS0NH5bv3iBii5eNP512gY5RTe6qRy6Y/edit?usp=sharing
Visual Studio (VS): A full-fledged Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed primarily for professional developers working on large projects. It supports complex project types, extensive debugging, and a wide array of development tasks, key feature of visual studio includes; IntelliSense, Debugger, Code Navigation, Integrated Source Control, Integrated Source Control, Extensions and Integrations ect. Visual Studio Code (VS Code): A lightweight, extensible code editor aimed at developers who need a quick and versatile tool for code editing and debugging. It is particularly popular among web developers and those who prefer a minimal setup with customizable extensions, diferenece between visual studio and visual studio code is that Visual Studio is ideal for comprehensive development needs in a professional environment, while Visual Studio Code is best for lightweight, flexible development tasks and is widely favored for its speed and customization options.

Visual Studio offers a comprehensive suite of debugging tools designed to help developers identify, diagnose, and fix issues in their code. Here's an overview of key debugging tools and features; Breakpoints, Watch and QuickWatch Windows, Locals and Autos Windows, Immediate Window, Call Stack Window, Threads Window, Modules Window etc; VS Code’s debugging tools provide a streamlined way to pause code execution, inspect variables, and step through code to identify and resolve issues efficiently.
GitHub and Visual Studio integration enhances collaborative development by providing a cohesive environment for coding, reviewing, managing tasks, and automating workflows. This integration is exemplified in projects like .NET Core, where teams leverage these tools to deliver high-quality software efficiently; They can be used together in collaborative development like the use of version control, project management, code review and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment CI/CD.
I used reference like Chatgtp, Google and Youtube.
